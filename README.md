# uikit
AS3 UIKit Framework
Mobile GPU3D Framework to Create 60fps Mobile Application.

Some part of the framework ported from Apple-UIKit (~2011)

There was no good flash framework that using Mobile GPU3D on that time, so I created it using one of the world best and most well-known framework "Apple UIKit" as the reference and also want to use their DOCs to communicate how the framework works. I was also want my flash team to learn how to use Apple UIKit Framework while using flash.
